# ðŸŽ¨Exploring and Visualizing Machine Learning Details
In this repository I explore and visualize how ML mechanisms (algoritms, layers, metrics, etc.) work.

## Content
- ðŸ“©[Convolution Layers](https://github.com/anna-marshalova/visualizing-ml-details/blob/main/how-convolution-layers-work.ipynb).  
  What does image look like when it passes through convolution and pooling layer? How different are activations of different feature maps?
- ðŸ“…[Learning Rate Schedulers](https://github.com/anna-marshalova/visualizing-ml-details/blob/main/how-lr-schedulers-work.ipynb).  
  How learning rate changes at every step thanks with different schedulers? (Now only the scheduler from LLama2 and ReduceLROnPlateau).
- âš [Attention](https://github.com/anna-marshalova/visualizing-ml-details/blob/main/how-attention-works.ipynb).  
  Are results of Query*Key multiplication really higher for words that are related? Heatmapping scores for Self-Attention and Encoder-Decoder Attention of T5.
- ðŸ¤˜[ROC curves](https://github.com/anna-marshalova/visualizing-ml-details/blob/main/how-roc-curves-work.ipynb).  
  What do ROC curves look like for differrnt (true, pred) combinations? How do they differ from other metrics?
